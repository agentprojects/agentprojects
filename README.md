> small experiments · strong vibes · code as art

I create **vibe coding projects** —  
minimal, experimental, and curiosity-driven.

This space is a collection of small ideas, fast prototypes,  
and projects built for learning, exploration, and fun.

---

## What I’m Into
- Creative coding experiments  
- Minimal developer tools  
- AI-assisted ideas  
- Learning in public  

---

## Tech I Use
- JavaScript / TypeScript  
- Node.js  
- Python  
- Web technologies  
- AI & automation  

---

## Philosophy
I believe code doesn’t need to be perfect to be meaningful.  
It should be **alive**, expressive, and enjoyable to build.

Ship early. Explore freely. Iterate with intention.

## Projects
Selected experiments live in this profile.  
More coming as ideas turn into code.

---

## Notes
This profile is intentionally minimal.  
The focus is on the work — not the noise.
